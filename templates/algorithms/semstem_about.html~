Semstem is based on a structural expectation-maximization (structural EM) algorithm. It is the <em>first computer-based method able to estimate general latent tree structures</em>, unlike earlier methods that are usually restricted to bifurcating trees where all the extant texts are placed in the leaf nodes.

Here is an example of how Semstem works on one of the well-know benchmark data sets: <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ttonteri/casc/data.html">
the parzival data set</a>. On the left is the original structure and on the right is the tree learned by Semstm.
