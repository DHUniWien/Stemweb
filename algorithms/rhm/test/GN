<s

If
vaccilation
dwell
with
the
heart
,
the
soul
will
see
it
.
<s
2>
Shame
and
honour
clash
with
the
courage
of
a
steadfast

man
is
motley
like
the
magpie
.
<s
3>
But
such
a
man
may
yet
make
merry
,
for
Heaven
&
Hell
have
equal
part
in
him
.
<s
4>
Infidelity's
friend
is
black
all
over
and
takes
on
a
murky
hue
,
while
the
man
of
loyal
temper
holds
to
the
white
.
<s
5>
This
winged
companion
is
too
swift
for
unripe
wits
.
<s
6>
They
lack
the
power
to
grasp
it
.
<s
7>
For
it
will
wrench
past
them
like
a
startled
horse
!
<s
8>
So
it
is
with
a
dull
mirror
or
a
blind
man's
dream
.
<s
9>
There
several
faces
in
dim
outline
:
but
the
dark
image
does
not
abide
,
it
gives
but
a
moment's
joy
.
<s
10>
Who
tweaks
my
palm
where
never
a
hair
did
grow
?
<s
11>
He
would
have
learnt
close
grips
indeed
!
<s
12>
Were
I
to
cry
Oh
!

,
in
fear
of
that
it
would
mark
me
as
a
fool
.
<s
13>
Shall
I
find
loyalty
where
it
must
vanish
,
like
fire

in
a
well
,
or
dew
in
the
sun
?
<s
14>
On
the
other
hand

I
have
yet
to
meet
a
man
so
wise
that
he
would
not
gladly
know
what
guidance
this
story
requires
,
what
edification
it
brings
.
<s
15>
The
tale
never
loses
heart
,
but
flees

and
pursues
,
turns
tail
and
wheels
to
the
attack
and
doles
out
blame
and
praise
.
<s
16>
The
man
who
follows
all
there
vicissitudes
and
neither
outs
too
long
or
goes
astray
and
otherwise
knows
where
he
stands
has
been
well
served
by
mother
wit
.
<s
17>
Feigned
friendship
leads
to
the
fire
,
it
destroy
a
man's
nobility
like
hail
.
<s
18>
It's
loyalty
is
so
short
in
the
tail
that
if
it
meet
in
the
wood
with

gadflies
it
will
not
quit
a
bet
in
three
.
<s
19>
There
manifold
distinctions
do
not
all
relate
to
men
.
<s
20>
I
shall
set
there
marks
as
a
challenge

to
women
.
<s
21>
Let
any
who
would
learn
from
me
beware
to
whom
she
takes
her
honour
and
good
name
,
beware

whom
she
makes
free
of
her
love
and
precious
person
,
lest
she
regret
the
loss
of
both
chastity
and
affection
.
<s
22>
With
God
as
my
witness

I
bid
good
women
observe
restraint
.
<s
23>
The
lock
guarding
all
good
ways
is
modesty

I
need
not
wish
them
any
better
fortune
.
<s
24>
The
FALSE
will
gain
a
name
for
falsity

<s
25>

How
lasting
is
thin
ice
in
August's
torrid
sun
?
<s
26>
Their
credit
will
pass

as
soon

away
.
<s
27>
The
beauty
of
many
has
been
praised
for
and
wide
;
but
if
their
hearts
be
counterfeit
I
rate
them
as
I
should
a
bead
set
in
gold
.
<s
28>
But
I
do
not
reckon
it
a
tawdry
thing
when
the
noble
ruby
with
all
it's
virtues
is
fashioned
into
base
brass

for
this
I
would
liken
to

the
spirit
of
TRUE
womanhood
.
<s
29>
When
a
woman
acts
to
the
best
of
her
nature
you
will
not
find
me
surveying
her
complexion
or
probing
what
shields
her
heart
:
if
she
be
well
proofed
within
her
breast
,
her
good
name
is
safe
from
harm
.
<s
30>
Now
if
I
were
to
judge
of
men
and
women
as
I
know
them
a
long
story
it
would
be
.
<s
31>
Hear

then

what
manner
of
tale
this
is
,
telling
of
things
both
pleasant
and
sad
,
with
joy
and
trouble
for
company
.
<s
32>
Grant
there
were
three
of
me
,
each
with
skill
to
match
mine
:
there
would
still
be
need
of
unbridled
inspiration
to
tell
you
what
,

singlehanded
,

I
have
a
mind
to
tell

!
<s
33>
I
will
renew
a
tale
that
tells
of
great
fidelity
,
of
inborn
womanhood
and
manly
virtue
so
straight
as
never
was
bent
in
any
test
of
hardness
.
<s
34>
Steel
that
he
was
,
his
courage
never
failed
him
,
his
conquering
hand
seized
many
a
glorious
prize
when
he
came
to
battle
.
<s
35>
Dauntless
man

,
though
laggard
in
discretion
!
<s
36>

Thus

I
salute
the
hero

<s
37>

sweet
balm
to
women's
eyes
,
yet
women's
hearts
disease
!
<s
38>
Shunner
of
all

wrongdoing
!
<s
39>
As
yet
he
is










unborn
to
this
story
whom
I
have
chosen
for
the
part
,
the
man
of
whom
this
tale
is
told
and
all
the
marvels
in
it
.
<s
40>
There
is
a
custom
still
observed
today

wherever
our
western
neighbour's
law's
prevail
.
<s
41>
It
holds
even
on
German
soil
in
one
old
corner

you
don't
need
me
to
tell
you
that
!
<s
42>
Whoever
it
was
that
held
those
territories
yonder
ruled


nor
was
it
shame
to
him


that
the
eldest
brother
(
strange
though

TRUE
)
should
have
his
father's
whole
inheritance
.
<s
43>
That
death
should
sever
the
rights
of
which
their
father's
life
assured
them
was
the
cadets'
misfortune
.
<s
44>
Before
,
they
held
in
common
.
<s
45>
Now

the
eldest
holds
alone
.
<s
46>
Was
that
not
a
wise
man

who
laid
it
down

that
age
should
have
possession
?
<s
47>

Youth
has
it's
fill
of
good
things
,
old
of
sighs
and
sorrows'
!
<s
48>

There
never
was
a
fate
so
pitiful
as
age
and
poverty
!

<s
49>
I
will
not
palter
with
the
truth

that
kings
,
counts

dukes
should
suffer
dispossession
of
their
acres
,
all
but
the
oldest
son

what
an
outlandish
ordinance
!
