You need atleast django (1.3) and PypeR (and R) in your PYTHONPATH.

Django:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/

PypeR:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/rinpy/

Prototype folder contains very early prototype with no django, 
but it still needs pyper to be able to run the R code.
 

GIT workflow:

-- Start working, get latest version from master (ie. from github.com) --
> git pull

-- Do your work

-- Stop working, commit your work to your local repository, either --
> git add 'files_you_have_been_working_with' 			# Commits only named files 
> git commit -m 'commit_message_which_makes_some_sense'

-- OR --
> git commit -a -m 'message'    				# This commits all files.   

-- HOX! Commit only commits to your local repository. So you need to push it to master
-- repository (to github.com). Also remember to add some meaningful commit message. 
-- Don't use -m "another commit".
> git push
