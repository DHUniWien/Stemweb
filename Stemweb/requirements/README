These instructions are for linux and OSX. 

1.)

Setup a database to be used with the Stemweb. Good choices are sqlite for 
personal use and psql or mysql for production use. Internet has lot of good 
tutorials about using any of the mentioned.

2.) 

Copy Stemweb/local/lstrings_empty.py into Stemweb/local/lstrings.py and set 
all the relevant settings. See django projects documentation about settings. 
Stemweb is currently deployed for django 1.3.1 

If you want to be able to use the Stemweb as microservice for other ip:s,
change algorithm/lsettings.py to present TRUSTED_SERVERS list of dictionaries
with ("ip", <trusted id>) - key-value pairs. 

3.)

Download and install python 2.7.5 and set the $PATH variable so that python 2.7.5
is default python interpreter. Then download and install pip 
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/). It's adviced to do these steps in this 
order as pip gets installed into particular python version and if pip uses
different interpreter as virtualenv it might cause errors. After you have
succesfully installed new virtualenv (step 5.a) you should be able to change
$PATH back (that's the whole reason of virtual environments).

4) 

Install freetype2 and libpng. You can check if they are already installed 
in your system with:

$ find /usr -name freetype2
$ find /usr -name *libpng* 

On OSX this does not mean that matplotlib installation will automatically
locate the freetype2 as it can be obtained many ways. However, libpng 
should come as default in later (10.x?) OSX installations.

5.a)

Run install.sh. It takes single optional argument which is a path to python
install. Python version used should be 2.7.5, but since most of the server 
technologies don't allow different major/minor versions of python than the
one the server uses, you have to check which one is the right choice for 
you. If no path is given "usr/bin/python2.7" is presumed. For example:

$ ./install.sh /home/username/.local/bin/python2.6

Script first installs virtualenv and sets up bare virtual environment to 
'current/working/directory/stemenv'. This virtual environment is usable by 
command (bash):

$ source path/to/stemenv/bin/activate 

and can be stopped with:

$ deactivate 

Read more about virtualenv from: http://www.virtualenv.org/

Newly created virtualenv is then activated (and on linux numpy & matplotlib)
and all the python packages in 'requirements.txt' are downloaded installed 
into 'stemenv' virtualenv.

In OSX you have to activate your virtualenv manually as stated above and 
install matplotlib 1.1.0 and scipy 0.10.1 (both have numpy 1.5.1 as 
prerequisite) succesfully in there. This can get a little bit tricky for OSX 
as matplotlib needs non-python package freetype2. See for example: 

http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/installing.html
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1477144/compile-matplotlib-for-python-on-snow-leopard

5.b)
If you don't want to create your own virtual environment for Stemweb, then 
use command:

$ [sudo] pip install [--user] -r requirements.txt

to install all the packages to standard folders. You still need to install 
matplotlib with all the dependencies manually. Beware that Stemweb uses 
python 2.7.5 to be able to run fluently. That's why, if your standard python 
installation is different version, use of virtual environment is highly
encouraged.
