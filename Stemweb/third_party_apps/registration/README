### Changes made in this project ###

ReCaptcha field into registration form:

*	Added new form with captcha service as 
	RegistrationFormUniqueEmailWithReCaptcha.
	
*	Changed default backend to use this form.

*	Register view now needs recaptcha_works fix_recaptcha_remote_ip decorator.

ReCaptcha field into login form as this was the most suitable place for this.

*	Made child class of django.contrib.auth.forms AuthenticationForm in 
	registration.forms as AuthenticationFormWithReCaptcha and added recaptcha
	field into it.
	
*	Copied django.contrid.auth.views.login into registration.views, since 
	I didn't know if one could add required decorators into method call.
	Added @fix_recaptha_remote_ip decorator into copied view.

*	Changed authentication_form's default value in above view into 
	AuthenticationFormWithReCaptcha.
	
* 	changed auth_urls /login to direct into registration.views.login instead
	of django.contrib.auth.views.login
